Speech Recognition and Video Capture App
This project is a Python-based application that integrates speech recognition, text-to-speech (TTS) functionality, and video capture using a webcam. The application uses the Streamlit library to create an interactive web interface.

Features
Speech Recognition: Captures spoken input via the microphone and converts it to text using Google Speech Recognition.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Generates a spoken response to the recognized text using the pyttsx3 library.
Video Capture: Captures frames from the webcam and displays them in the Streamlit interface.
Streamlit Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly web-based interface for interacting with the app.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

streamlit
speechrecognition
pyttsx3
opencv-python
You can install these dependencies using pip:


pip install streamlit speechrecognition pyttsx3 opencv-python
Getting Started
Clone the repository:


git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Ensure you have Python installed:

This project requires Python 3.6 or higher. If you don't have Python installed, download it from the official Python website.

Install the required libraries:

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt file, use the following command instead:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit speechrecognition pyttsx3 opencv-python
Run the Streamlit App:

Execute the following command to start the Streamlit app:


streamlit run streamlit_script.py
Replace streamlit_script.py with the actual name of your Python script if it's different.

Using the Application:

Start Listening: Click the "Start Listening" button to begin speech recognition. The app will capture your voice input and display the recognized text on the screen.
Capture Frame: The app will also capture a frame from your webcam and display it within the interface.
Stop and Release Camera: Click this button to release the webcam and stop the application.

Notes
The application uses Google Speech Recognition, which requires an internet connection.
The response generation is currently a placeholder and can be enhanced by integrating a language model or another form of AI-based response generation.
